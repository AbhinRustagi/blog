I recently decided to build a personal project that I can use personally. I call it Zeus. I intend it to overlook and help manage a lot of small personal goals or tasks I want to complete online. 

With more and more accessible LLMs, it makes for a great opportunity to work on a custom AI assistant. 

## #1 Blog

I've wanted to be consistent at writing for a long time, and I love writing in Markdown. I don't feel particularly overjoyed by the UX offered by some of the apps out there, and most do not offer free or cheap cloud storage. 

So I decided the first sub-app I want to include in Zeus will be a Markdown-powered content management for my blog. 

## #2 Photo of the Day

I was particularly impressed by [Ben Borger's Photo of the Day project](https://photos.ben.page/?ref=https://www.abhin.dev/blog/zeus). I think it's an awesome way to journal publicly. As someone who doesn't particularly enjoy Snapchat or Instagram, this idea still somehow appealed to me. 

Second sub-app - content management for a personal Photo of the Day app.

## #3 WWW

Personal website. The tiring process of keeping your website up to date can be tiring and forgetful. Sometime back, I decided that going forward, I'm gonna build websites that are statically generated with content. I decided that once I finalize a design template (which itself is annoying), I want a way to be able to just keep changing the content. I was tempted to use a complex database + CMS architecture, but it seemed like overkill.

## #4 Eats

## #5 I'll read that later

Inspired by Piet Terheyden's [F*ck I wish I knew that list](https://fuckiwishiknewth.at/).
