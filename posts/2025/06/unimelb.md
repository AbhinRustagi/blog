Why did I do this? Well, my time at Openhouse rendered me insane working from home. 

A light intro that talks about why you decided to pursue a Master’s, why Melbourne, and why UniMelb.

    Was it career-driven, adventure-seeking, or “anything to get out of Delhi traffic”?

Academic Life at UniMelb

    How was the course structure?

    Which subjects or professors stood out?

    Group assignments: heaven, hell, or both?

    Did you go in knowing Python and come out speaking TensorFlow?

    Anything that surprised you about studying there?

The Social Stuff – Life Outside Lectures

    Flatmates, friends, clubs, societies?

    CISSA, ReWorld, Boolean Tech—what you built beyond grades.

    Cultural quirks: Sunday brunches, barbecues, sports culture, or how every second person owns a dog.

Living in Melbourne – The Good, The Expensive, and The Unexpected

    How did you find housing?

    Public transport, grocery budgets, weather mood swings?

    Favorite local haunts—cafes, parks, libraries, quiet spots.

    A funny “Melbourne moment” (e.g., battling magpies or trams confusing your Google Maps).

Work, Internships, and The Hustle

    Juggling studies with part-time work/freelance/internships.

    The hunt for industry projects or placements.

    What you learned on the job that no course covered.

Challenges & Growth

    Moments you struggled—mentally, financially, academically.

    How you adapted, what you learned about yourself.

    A little “letter to past self” moment might go here.

The Now – What’s Next?

    What you’re working on now (Ned, Zeus, ReWorld Earth).

    Future plans—career moves, open-source dreams, or chilling for a bit.

Final Reflections – Would You Do It Again?

    Advice to future students.

    Was it worth it?

    Melbourne in one word? (Bonus: pick a coffee roast to match.)
